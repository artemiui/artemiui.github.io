description: an overview of my obsidian-git notetaking system

# general
theme : transparent
font : helvetica
vim binds : on

# plugins (* marked is, to me, essential)
- readitlater* : pasting directly from my clipboard to an individual note by one click, super convenient
- omnisearch* : easily search over notes in my vault
- smart connections* : draws connections through semantics, super helpful if lazy with linking
- link embed : makes links easier to look at
- image converter : technically just for compressing image attachments to webp
- keep the rhythm : cool dashboard haha

# my main folders
6 folders all serve specific, albeit deductive purposes
- area : contains all notes, all domains are organized via a parent note instead of folder for drawing links
- attachments : default folder for pasted pictures, assets
- clipboard : folder containing readitlater, specific notes with labels based on domain (see image below)
- personal : self-explanatory
- templates : template directory for the core templates plugin
- local data : what i tell git to ignore when syncing, notes i want to keep on my machine

*i do my synchronization with other devices via git.*

# my templates (as of now)
- knowledge block : a quick note basically of something i learned
- llm query : like a knowledge block, this is where i put quick notes of queries on my llm that i find interesting or informative and want to save. this basically acts like notebooklm's save note feature for my vault.
- project stack : for when im making a project, keep track
- daily : self-explanatory

# my media database (optional)
- i made this to get away from needing to handle accounts in mal, anilist, letterboxd, goodreads, backloggd, and so on. it calms my nerves to know that my data isn't spread out on 20 different platforms at a time. more on this if anyone's actually interested.
