Type systems are one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science. They provide a way to categorize values and ensure that operations are performed correctly.

## Static vs Dynamic Typing

Static type systems check types at compile time, while dynamic type systems check at runtime. Each approach has its trade-offs.

### Static Typing

Static typing catches errors early in the development process. Languages like TypeScript, Rust, and Haskell use static type systems.

### Dynamic Typing

Dynamic typing offers more flexibility and faster iteration. Python and JavaScript are examples of dynamically typed languages.

## Type Inference

Modern type systems often include type inference, allowing the compiler to deduce types without explicit annotations.

## Conclusion

Understanding type systems helps developers write more robust and maintainable code. The choice between static and dynamic typing depends on the project's requirements and team preferences.
