# An Overview

The case with the cities of Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela is not very far-off from that of different locales tested with this kind of study. Microplastic contamination exists, but it isn't entirely recognized by everyone. Especially fisheries products. 

In this study, we determine, primarily, the relationship of knowledge and attitudes of microplastic contamination of fisheries products in the district of Metro Manila most well-known for their active fisheries and aquaculture sector. We found that a moderate positive correlation was found between attitudes and knowledge which was expected. However, other predictors, including educational level, were unexpectingly not that effective.

# The Statistical Methods

We employed analyses through this process:
- Initially, we pilot-tested 20 participants to test adaptation and calculated reliability through Cronbach's $\alpha$. We had a reasonable result of 0.806 for attitudes, and 0.926 for knowledge levels.
- We then employed normality testing, although one issue was that we didn't take note of nor document the initial distribution at 20 respondents. Unideal, but still works regardless. Final distribution is as follows:

- At the time, I wasn't very fluent in distributions, as all we were aware of was normality. If it wasn't a bell-curve, it was non-parametric. That was it. However, I guess it didn't matter much as we were simply hypotheses testing. On the other side, I wish I could've done more analysis. I was already in possession of data that could've been classified, so why not?

## Here's what I kind of regretted the most during analyses:

I hadn't accounted for the 6 divisions for the attitudes variable during the final project. This was so that I'd only deal with simpler data. It was, however, one of the more interesting parts of the analysis. As we can see from the following heatmap 'complacency', 'fear', 'indifference' are significant predictors. Studying such sociological features would've been more complicated, but would showcase a much deeper understanding of the general consensus, albeit numerically.

In addition, employing multilinear regression by dividing consensus into groups never really made sense to me, as it would make more sense to distinguish categories by educational level rather than municipality. Municipal stratification was only necessary for calculating representative sample size, and does not meaningfully say anything about differences in score as expected. Given as the demographics themselves are not entirely that different, it made no sense to choose it as a distinct categorical variable during analysis.

# The Takeaway

There were many ways to make this paper way better than it is in statistical methods. Given the current status of my experience with data science, although not much, I think I would've done a better job at developing my research questions. Although it does go to show that you have to start somewhere. This was my first publication anyway.
