## le 1: limits and continuity: indeterminates, limits involving infinity, ivt, l'hopital's
### 1.1: limits, indeterminates, rationalization
#### the intuitive definition of a limit
- $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ means that as $x$ gets arbitrarily close to $a$ (but not equal to $a$), $f(x)$ gets arbitrarily close to $L$. we do not necessarily care what happens to $a$ unless we are evaluating the limit at $a$ as a point specifically. a more appropriate term for this evaluation would be to check for continuity.
		$\implies f$ is continuous at $a$ if $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$, meaning the graph has no breaks, jumps, or holes at $x = a$.
- something that we can do whenever a limit returns $\frac{0}{0}$ is to 
	1.  *factorization:* for a review, see [this video]().
	2. *rationalization*: typically also with special products, involving radicals wherein we simply multiply by a form of $\frac{1}{1}$ to cancel out a root.
		take for example, we are asked to evaluate the limit $x \rightarrow 1$ for $f(x) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{x}-1}{\sqrt{x}-1}$ 
		$$\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\sqrt[3]{x}-1}{\sqrt{x}-1}$$
		we multiply the expression by a special product identity but is still equal to one over one, we are basically just scaling the expression by a another expression without adding onto it. here, we use the identity: $$a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$$note that because $\sqrt[3]{x}-1$ can be treated as $(a-b)$ pertaining to the identity, we can multiply another  $(a^2+ab+b^2)$ to get a complete expression $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$ which we have established to be equal to $a^3-b^3$.  therefore, we cancel out the cubic root in $\sqrt[3]{x}-1$, and are left with $x-1$.

$$\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{\sqrt[3]{x}-1}{\sqrt{x}-1} \cdot \frac{(\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1}{(\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1}$$
	
		because we only treat the radical in the numerator, our denominator remains conjoined to $(\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1$.
		
$$\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x-1}{(\sqrt{x}-1)((\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1)}$$ 
		
		we see that there is another radical that we can cancel out in the bottom expression $\sqrt{x} - 1$, therefore we can utilize another identity:
		$$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$$  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{x-1}{(\sqrt{x}-1)((\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1)} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{x}+1}{\sqrt{x}+1} \\[0.5em]
&\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(x-1)(\sqrt{x}+1)}{(x-1)((\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1)} \\[0.5em]
&\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(\sqrt{x}+1)}{((\sqrt[3]{x})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{x}) + 1)} \quad \text{then substituting,} \\[0.5em]
&\implies \lim_{x \rightarrow 1} \frac{(\sqrt{1}+1)}{((\sqrt[3]{1})^2 + (\sqrt[3]{1}) + 1)} \\[0.5em]
&\therefore \frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}
$$ 
### 1.2 one-sided limits

- take for example you want to assess the limit at $a$ from the right of the equation, this is denoted as $a^+$ and likewise from the right, it is $a^-$. this just means we are assessing values of $a$ with a difference of either $0^+$ or $0^-$. neither of these zeroes actually are true zero, therefore when performing operations the symbol for right and left are necessary. 
- we can interpret both $0^+$ or $0^-$ as non-zero positive or negative values respectively. they are not zero, but are any arbitrary value infinitesimally close to zero.
- we use one-sided limits when the two-sided limit doesn't exist or we want to analyze behavior from only one side. some formal intuitive definitions are the following:

	- $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L$ means as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right where we take values greater than x, or $x > a$, and $f(x)$ approaches a limit $L$. likewise, from the left, $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L$ means as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left (with $x < a$), $f(x)$ approaches $L$.
	- The two-sided limit *exists* $\iff$ both one-sided limits *exist* and *are equal*: $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L$.
	
- note that a one-sided limit can exist even while the two-sided limit does not exist. they are not mutually exclusive.
- recall the use of piecewise functions, where $f(x)$ can have multiple definitions at different domains, but are still functions as all corresponding values of $y$ are of only a single $x$ value. 
	- one-sided limits are easily understood in this regard, as piecewise functions typically have different approached $y$ values if we are evaluating the limit at a point where our definitions of $f$ change.
- some important things to take note of:
	1. the piecewise definition of absolute values
		denoted by $f(x)=|x|$ where we can represent the same concept as:
$$
|x| = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x \ge 0 \\ -x & \text{if } x < 0 \end{cases}
$$
		this is used in limit problems with nested absolute values. absolute value functions will be used more than just the simple base case. for example:
		$f(x) = |x+2|$, where we can represent the same function as: $$|x+2| = \begin{cases} x+2 & \text{if } x \ge -2 \\ -(x+2) & \text{if } x < -2 \end{cases}$$
	
	2. greatest integer functions or the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions)
	- the greatest integer function considers the closest *floor* integer to whichever output is evaluated. for example, we are testing the right-sided limit $x \rightarrow 2^+$ where $f(x) = \lfloor2x\rfloor$, our output becomes $y = 4^+$. the floor integer corresponding to $4^+$ where  $4^+ \neq 4$ but instead $4 + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small number, the closest value to the right or the *floor* is 4. see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68Hl7DhsuQ) for a more intuitive guide to gifs.
	- a more formal definition would be: $$ \lfloor x \rfloor = \max \{\, n \in \mathbb{Z} \mid n \le x \,\} $$

### 1.3a infinite limits
- infinite limits are typically descriptive of asymptotic behavior, i.e. rational functions like $\frac{1}{x}$.
- note that even with infinite limits, **it does not mean that it exists.** it is simply used to describe the direction where the output is increasing infinitely.
- for points that are excluded in the graph, say a point $x = 2$ but the your range is restricted to $(-\infty , 2]$, are discontinuous and do not approach an infinitely large value. it only approaches $L=2$. 
- let us take for example the left and right sides of a limit $x \rightarrow 0$ in the function:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$$
- from the left, we can intuitively assess from the graph of $f(x)$ that it approaches an infinitely decreasing value which we note as $-\infty$ and from the right as an infinitely increasing value $+\infty$.
- the line with eq. $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote of its graph $f$ if atleast one of the following conditions are satisfied:
	1. $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} = + \infty$
	2. $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^-} = -\infty$
	3. $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} = + \infty$
	4. $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} = -\infty$
- note that simply just says that if it's approaching an infinitely increasing output value, it's a vertical asymptote.
- **constant numerator, infinite denominator:** [in the lecture video for 1.3 part 1](https://youtu.be/DOAHJoI3Xxk?list=PL2kta8PKtfXSd5McJgIrHwFUd-PvSZEIW&t=599), we are shown a formal definition for when $lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = c$  and $lim_{x \rightarrow a} g(x) = 0$, however intuitively we can simply deduce that it is the simply the rules for dividing with negative values. simply understand that if c is positive and divided by some arbitrary non-zero positive number, it is positive. the opposite case happens when c is positive and is divided by some arbitrary non-zero negative number, then it becomes negative. simply: $\frac{+}{-}$ and $\frac{-}{+}$ rules.
- **additive properties concerning infinity:** likewise, when we decompose an expression, [in the case of operations with infinite limits](https://youtu.be/DOAHJoI3Xxk?list=PL2kta8PKtfXSd5McJgIrHwFUd-PvSZEIW&t=961), it should be easy to grasp how adding or subtracting an instance of $\pm\infty$ to a constant will move its graph to the direction of infinity.
	**special case:** when we subtract $+\infty$ from another $+\infty$, or add a $-\infty$ to a $+\infty$ 
- **multiplicative properties and infinity:** likewise in the case of multiplying, we can treat $\infty$ as a sort of variable. our special case here is involving a multiplication with true zero, wherein our answer is undefined. in notation: $(\pm\infty)(0) = undefined$ 
- **recall our indeterminate forms:**
	1. $(+\infty) - (+\infty) = ?$ 
	2. $(+\infty) + (-\infty) = ?$
	3. $(0)(\pm\infty) = ?$

let's solve some examples involving infinite limits:
1. $lim_{x \rightarrow 0^+} \frac{x^2-3}{x^3+x^2}$
		$\implies\frac{-3^-}{0^+} = -\infty$
2. $lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-} \frac{2x^3 - 5x^2}{x^2 - 1}$
		$\implies \frac{2x^3 - 5x^2}{x^2 - 1} = \frac{x(2x^2 - 5x)}{(x+1)(x-1)}= \frac{(1^-)(2(1^-)^2 - 5(1^-))}{((1^-)+1)((1^-)-1)} = \frac{-3}{(2^-)(0^-)} = \frac{-3}{0^+} = -\infty$
3. $lim_{x \rightarrow 2^+} \frac{\lfloor x \rfloor - 1}{\lfloor x \rfloor - x}$
		$\implies \frac{\lfloor 2^+ \rfloor - 1}{\lfloor 2^+\rfloor - 2^+} = \frac{1^+}{2 - 2^+} = \frac{1^+}{0^+} = +\infty$

### 1.3b limits approaching infinity
- such limits are descriptive of horizontal asymptotes as $x \rightarrow \pm\infty$.
- most limit theorems apply in the same manner, meaning we may treat limits where $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$ the same way we do with limits $x \rightarrow c$.
- when we encounter the indeterminate type $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ for $lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ we may apply a technique by multiplying $\frac{1}{x^n}$, the reciprocal of its degree to both the numerator and the denominator. 
let's take, for example, the following limit where x is increasing infinitely.
$$lim_{x \rightarrow +\infty} \frac{3x^2+x-1}{x^2+3}$$
$\implies lim_{x \rightarrow +\infty} \frac{3x^2+x-1}{x^2+3} \frac{\frac{1}{x^2}}{\frac{1}{x^2}} \implies lim_{x \rightarrow +\infty} \frac{3+\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x^2}}{1+\frac{3}{x^2}}$ all instances of rational expressions within the function have a limit $L = 0$ as recall that $\frac{1}{\pm\infty} = 0$ we are left with the expression $\frac{3}{1} = 3$.
