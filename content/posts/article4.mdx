# a few things
I think it's important to get out of the way that anyone can do what I do. I am, in absolutely no way, a special person. *Anyone* can do what I do given the right circumstances, the right opportunities, and the right time. The greatest thing that I have that allows me to do all this is my family, my friends, my mentors, and my peers. I am overly privileged to have all of them support me. To you, who's reading this, u can do this all too. trust.

anyway, now that that's out of the way, i worked a lot this year. it was extremely busy to say the least and the goal with this article is summarize it all up. this year was particularly hectic because i graduated from high school and started college and adjusting was the absolute worse for me.

# the elephant in the room
first thing's first, **i got into my dream university**, the university of the philippines - **diliman**. extra bold because i want to. getting into up was something i'd dreamt of since the advent of high school and it's been genuinely an amazing time being a student here. unfortunately, early on in the semester i'd face a lot of personal hardships so i couldn't really spend as much time as i'd wanted to enjoying my time in school.

# acknowledgements
another major achievement i'd consider is i got my groupmates, all 6 of them to receive two medals in graduation. thank you, kelly, cauley, paul, chad, raf, and allan. and of course to our adviser, sir jojit. 

to my parents, lola, my sisters, thank you so much for being the absolute best. none of this, and i mean absolutely none would be possible without them. if it weren't for them, i'd probably be too tired to work on anything.

to my friends and classmates, i wouldn't have lasted a day without any of you. let's take jc for example: we have this running gag where i basically owe my achievements to the guy. i never have battery on my phone and his powerbank's always there to save the day. i kid u not bro u r mvp tysm.

and ofcourse, to Almighty God!

# what's next?
some systems i want to set in place for this year is in the following domains:
1. **fitness:** go to the gym atleast 3 times a week
2. **finance**: have an extensive tracker of finances, expenditure, budget
3. **academics:** 1.00s broda, also get into econ!! or physics if ure daring
4. **projects:** atleast 1-3 per month would do. build BIGGER! do the electronics projects, the raytracing engine, and rom hack u've always wanted. also join a hackathon pls, as many as u can preferably.
	- also, post more. i've actually been doing this for years so i don't know why i hesitate so much. it's actually pretty much why i made this blog.
5. **networking:** meet more likeminded people who love building and dont make u feel bad for wanting so much in life.
on a serious note, i know probably won't achieve as much as the 2024-2025 period given the new environment. it definitely isn't the same. but that's ok, clean slate type shi.
## some other measurable goals:
1. 1-2 hackathons or competitions
2. transfer to desired degree program
3. travel more alone
4. larger, more consistent personal income
5. track my coffee adventures (maybe make that a page here)
6. more piano, more gigs, more connections woo
7. post videos, talk, express more freely


*la fine.*
