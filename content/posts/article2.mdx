# Why I made this

I think a lot of my visual "fluency" comes from the fact that I would often find the most obscure, esoteric, and niche editors online because of how talented they all were. I've met some of these people, and can tell that they're all really just extremely talented and creative. Well, some of them are assholes too but it's been years so who knows?
