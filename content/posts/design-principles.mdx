# Design Principles I Live By

Over years of designing interfaces and experiences, I've developed a set of principles that guide my work.

## Clarity Over Cleverness

The best design is invisible. Users shouldn't have to think about how to use something—it should be intuitive.

## Less is More

Every element should have a purpose. If removing something doesn't hurt functionality, it probably shouldn't be there.

## Consistency Matters

Consistent patterns create familiarity. Once users learn one part of your interface, they can apply that knowledge elsewhere.

## Accessibility First

Designing for accessibility benefits everyone. Good contrast, clear typography, and keyboard navigation aren't optional.

## Iterate and Learn

Design is never finished. The best designs evolve based on user feedback and changing needs.
